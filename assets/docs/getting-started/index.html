<h1>Welcome</h1>
<div class="rule"></div>
<p>
    The goal of this guide, is to get you up and running, and well on your way to build custom apps that interact with Encompass
    data.
</p>
<p>
    We will also cover, IDEs, tooling and TypeScript.
</p>

<h2>Assumptions</h2>
<p>
    This documentation assumes that you are already familiar with JavaScript, and some of the tools from the latest standards
    such as classes and modules. The code samples are written using TypeScript. Most Angular code can be written with just
    the latest JavaScript, using types for dependency injection, and using decorators for metadata.
</p>
<p>
    This documentation also assumes that you have a development version of Encompass (ECP) running in your development enviornment.
    If you don't have this you will need to contact your Encompass development lead for help setting this up.
</p>

<h2>Whats Next?</h2>
<p>
    First things first. You need to be able to edit code. While you can use something simple, like Notepad, an IDE will make
    your life much easier.
