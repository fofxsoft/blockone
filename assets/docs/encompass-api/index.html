<p class="note">
    Before you start this tutorial, you will need to be an Encompass Publisher. Encompass needs to grant access. Once you are
    a publisher Encompass will give you a Publisher Name and API Token.
</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    The Encompass API is not a typical MVC web API. It is "open ended", and allows you to create and edit your own API commands.
    It handles authentication at a publisher level and allows Encompass customers to choose which commands are allowed access
    to their data.
</p>
<p>
    These commands are created using systems that support the API export. Here is a basic list of supported systems;
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Tables (Export Only)</li>
    <li>Reports (Export Only)</li>
    <li>Single Table Import (Import Only)</li>
    <li>EDBL Import (Import Only)</li>
</ul>
<p>
    This tutorial will use Tables, Reports and Single Table Imports.
</p>

<h2>Assumptions</h2>

    This tutorial will use JSON data. We assume that you are fabiliar with JSON data.
