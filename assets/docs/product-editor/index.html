        <li>Bind component methods to user events, like keystrokes and clicks.</li>
        <li>Enable users to select a product from a master list and edit that product in the details view.</li>
        <li>Create a shared service to assemble the products from the Encompass API.</li>

<h2>What you'll build</h2>
<p>
    Here is what this app will look like. Starting with the Dashboard.
</p>
<p>
    <div class="screen" style="padding: 0; background: #fafafa;">
        <img src="/assets/docs/product-editor/dashboard.png" width="100%">
    </div>
</p>
<p>
    From there users will be able to click on Products in the menu on the left. This will display the product list.
</p>
<p>
    <div class="screen" style="padding: 0; background: #fafafa;">
        <img src="/assets/docs/product-editor/product-list.png" width="100%">
    </div>
</p>
<p>
    Users will be able to click on any product in the product list. This will display the product detail.
</p>
<p>
    <div class="screen" style="padding: 0; background: #fafafa;">
        <img src="/assets/docs/product-editor/product-detail.png" width="100%">
    </div>
</p>
<p>
    Users will be able to edit, name, proce, case price, and three barcode fields. If the product doesn't have a supplier product
    number, users will be able to enter it. Once the supplier product number is set, it will not be editable.
