<h1>Node.js, npm and Sass</h1>
<div class="rule"></div>
<p>
    You will need these frameworks and tools installed in order to build, run and test Angular apps.
</p>

<h2>Install Node.js and npm</h2>
<p>
    Node.js and npm are a package. Head over to the
    <a href="https://nodejs.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Node.js</a> website. Download and install.
</p>
<p class="note">
    Verify that node is working. Run
    <b>node -v</b> in the terminal.command prompt.
</p>

<h2>Install Sass</h2>
<p>
    CSS on its own can be fun, but stylesheets are getting larger, more complex, and harder to maintain. This is where a preprocessor
    can help. Sass lets you use features that don't exist in CSS yet like variables, nesting, mixins, inheritance and other
    nifty goodies that make writing CSS fun again.
</p>
<p class="note">
    Verify is Sass ins installed. Run
    <b>sass -v</b> in the terminal.command prompt.
</p>

<h2>Install Sass on Linux</h2>
<p>
    If you're using a distribution of Linux, you'll need to install Ruby first. You can install Ruby through your package manager.
    You will also need the build-essential package, available through a package manager as well.
</p>
<p class="terminal">
    sudo gem install sass --no-user-install
</p>

<h2>Install Sass on Mac</h2>
<p>
    If you prefer the command line over an application then getting Sass set up is a fairly quick process. Sass has a Ruby dependency
    but if you're using a Mac, congratulations, Ruby comes pre-installed.
</p>
<p class="terminal">
    sudo gem install sass
</p>

<h2>Install Sass on Windows</h2>
<p>
    Before you start using Sass you will need to install Ruby. The fastest way to get Ruby on your Windows computer is to use
    <a href="https://rubyinstaller.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ruby Installer</a>. It's a single-click installer that will get everything set up for you super fast.
</p>
<p>
    The installer will also install a Ruby command line powershell application that will let you use the Ruby libraries.
</p>
<p class="note">
    Sass requires the
    <a href="https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ruby 2.4.3</a>. Sass is not compatiable with Ruby >= 2.5. Version 2.5 will cause an error.
</p>
<p>
    Open the
    <b>Command Prompt</b> and run this command;
</p>
<p class="terminal">
    gem install sass
</p>

<h2>Install Visual Studio Code Extentions</h2>
<p>
    By default VS Code does not have intellisense for CSS, SCSS, SVG and XML files. You will need to use VS Code extentions to
    handle these file types.
</p>
<p>
    These are available in the Visual Studio Marketplace. Install the
    <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sasa.vscode-sass-format" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sass Formatter</a>, the
    <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fabianlauer.vs-code-xml-format" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">XML Formatter</a> and
    <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jock.svg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">SVG Language Support</a>.
