<h1>Angular CLI</h1>
<div class="rule"></div>
<p>
    The goal in this guide is to setup your development enviornment needed to build and run a simple application in TypeScript,
    using the Angular CLI while adhering to the Style Guide recommendations that benefit every project.
</p>
<p>
    By the end of this guide, you'll have a basic understanding of development with the CLI and a foundation for both these
    documentation samples and for real world applications.
</p>

<h2>Set up the Development Environment</h2>
<p>
    You need to set up your development environment before you can do anything.
</p>
<p>
    Install
    <a href="/docs/getting-started/node-sass">node and npm</a> if they are not already on your machine.
</p>
<p class="note">
    Verify that you are running at least node 6.9.x and npm 3.x.x by running node -v and npm -v in a terminal/console window.
    Older versions produce errors, but newer versions are fine.
</p>
<p>
    Install
    <a href="/docs/getting-started/node-sass">sass-lang</a> is it is not already installed.
</p>
<p class="note">
    We will be using sass throughout these tutorials. This helps make css easier.
</p>
<p>
    Now install the
    <a href="https://angular.io" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">@angular/cli</a> globally.
</p>
<p class="terminal">
    npm install -g @angular/cli
</p>

<h2>Create a new project</h2>
<p>
    Open a terminal/command window.
</p>
<p>
    Generate a new project and skeleton application by running the following commands:
</p>
<p class="terminal">
    ng new getting-started-app --style=scss
</p>
<p class="note">
    Patience, please. It takes time to set up a new project; most of it is spent installing npm packages.
</p>

<h2>Serve the application</h2>
<p>
    Go to the project directory and launch the server.
</p>
<p class="terminal">
    cd getting-started-app
    <br> ng serve --open
</p>
<p>
    The
    <b>ng serve</b> command launches the server, watches your files, and rebuilds the app as you make changes to those files.
</p>
<p>
    Using the
    <b>--open</b> (or just
    <b>-o</b>) option will automatically open your browser on
    <b>http://localhost:4200/</b>.
</p>
<p>
    Your app greets you with a message:
</p>
<p>
    <div class="screen-title">
        http://localhost:4200/
    </div>
    <div class="screen">
        <span style="font-size: 28px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Georgia, serif; font-weight: bold;">Welcome to app!!</span>
        <br>
        <img src="/assets/docs/getting-started/angular.png" width="250" height="250">
    </div>
</p>

<h2>Edit your first component</h2>
<p>
    The CLI created the first component for you. This is the root component and it is named
    <b>app-root</b>. You can find it in
    <b>./src/app/app.component.ts</b>.
</p>
<p>
    Open the component file and change the
    <b>title</b> property from Welcome to app!! to Welcome to My First App!!:
</p>
<p>
    <div class="code-title">
        src/app/app.component.ts
    </div>
    <pre class="code"><span style="color: #0000ff">export</span> <span style="color: #0000ff">class</span> AppComponent {
    title = <span style="color: #a31515">&#39;My First App&#39;</span>;
}</pre>
</p>
<p>
    The browser reloads automatically with the revised title. That's nice, but it could look better.
</p>
<p>
    Open
    <b>src/app/app.component.scss</b> and give the component some style.
</p>
<p>
    <div class="code-title">
        src/app/app.component.scss
    </div>
    <pre class="code">h1 {
    <span style="color: #0000ff">color</span>: #10b0c9;
    <span style="color: #0000ff">font-family</span>: Arial, Helvetica, <span style="color: #0000ff">sans-serif</span>;
    <span style="color: #0000ff">font-size</span>: 250%;
}</pre>
</p>
<p>
    <div class="screen-title">
        http://localhost:4200/
    </div>
    <div class="screen">
        <span style="color: #10b0c9; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 50px; font-weight: bold;">Welcome to My First App!!</span>
        <br>
        <img src="/assets/docs/getting-started/angular.png" width="250" height="250">
    </div>
</p>
<p>
    Looking good!
</p>

<h2>What's next?</h2>

</p>
<p>
    Review the folder structure created by the
    <b>ng new</b> command. Familiraize yourself with the
    <b>root</b> and
    <b>src</b> folders. For further reading head over to
