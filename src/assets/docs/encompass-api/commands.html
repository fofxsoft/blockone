<h1>API Commands</h1>
<div class="rule"></div>
<p>
    Let's get familiar with the API Commands table. This is where the definition of your API lives.
</p>

<h2>Navigating to the API Commands Table</h2>
<p>
    Log in to your publisher site. For this example we will use
    <b>test.encompass8.com.</b>
</p>
<p>
    In the search field enter
    <b>API Commands</b>. You will be taken to
    <b>TableView.aspx?TableName=APICommands</b>.
</p>
<p>
    <div class="screen-title">
        TableView.aspx?TableName=APICommands
    </div>
    <div class="screen" style="background: #ededed;">
        <img src="/assets/docs/encompass-api/commands-table.png">
    </div>
</p>

<h2>Get to Know the API Command Fields</h2>

    <b>Add API Command Button.</b>
</p>

    A brif explination of each field;
</p>
<p class="note">
    Fields marked with a * are required. And any field you filter on will be automatically populated.
</p>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Publisher ID</b> Set this to your publisher name.
            <br>
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Command Name</b> This is the name of the command, you will use this in your application.
            <br>
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>URL</b> This is the URL inside Encompass. This tells the API how to get to the data. For this tutorial we will
            always append
            <b>Format=JSON</b>.
            <br>
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Allowed Parameter Array</b> By default Encompass will not allow any parameters. This is for security. This field
            "white-lists" parameters. When a parameter is passed to the API that is not "white-listed" the API call will
            fail.
            <br>
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Active</b> This allows you to deactivate a command without deleting it.
            <br>
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Is Global</b> This field allows you to install a command that doesn't need to be installed on every distributor
            site. Note: Many publishers might not see this field, because of permissions.
            <br>
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Description</b> This is an open test field. Allows you to add a description to your command.
            <br>
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p class="note">
    Typically you will not be making commands manually. Encompass has shortcuts in each system that supports API Commands.
</p>

<h2>Testing You API Commands</h2>
<p>
    Because Encompass uses an "open ended" system and handles authentication for you, you do not need any authrization headers.
    This makes it very easy to test API commands with your browser, with an exception to importing data that uses POST.
</p>
<p>
    Once you have created commands and installed them in your test site, you will be able to test and view the output by entering
    this URL;
</p>
<p class="terminal">
    <b>https://api.encompass8.com/aspx1/API.aspx?Token=</b><span style="color: #10b0c9;">[YOUR_TOKEN_HERE]</span><b>&EncompassID=</b><span style="color: #10b0c9;">[ENCOMPASS_ID_OF_TEST_SITE]</span><b>&Command=</b><span style="color: #10b0c9;">[COMMAND_NAME]</span>
</p>
<p>
    When you install an API Command you will be given a sample link that you can use for testing.
